00:00.000 --> 00:04.000 vertical:rl
<v Elias> We will show you how to use GOAT for location planning.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
<v Elias> In this example we are interested in bikesharing stations, you can do the same for other POIs.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
<v Elias> The task is to find new locations for the bikesharing scheme in Munich.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
<v Elias> First we need to identify areas with low accessibility.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
<v Elias> Large parts of the outer districts of Munich have poor accessibility to bikesharing stations.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
<v Elias> We are seeing that the population is distributed among all parts of the city.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
<v Elias> At the same time areas with high population have not always access to bikesharing stations.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
<v Elias> With the Walkability Population Index we can identify area were population

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
<v Elias> and walking accessibility to bikesharing stations is especially unbalanced.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
<v Elias> In this example we will show the effects of new bikesharing stations in the district of Neuperlach.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
<v Elias> You can draw, modify and delete points of interest.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
<v Elias> Let's place a new station close to the Metro station of QuiddestraÃŸe.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
<v Elias> You can give your station a name.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
<v Elias> Within some seconds the station will be uploaded

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
<v Elias> and the walkability heatmap will be refreshed.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
<v Elias> As you can see walkability has significantly improved!

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
<v Elias> Let's find another suitable location.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
<v Elias> There is an underserved district center close by.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
<v Elias> Let's place a new station at Karl-Marx-Zentrum.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
<v Elias> As we can see the effects on walkability are significant.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
<v Elias> Now let's check how the balance of walking accessibility to bikesharing stations and population has changed.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
<v Elias> Walking accessibility and population density are much more balanced in the area now.
