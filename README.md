# GOAT Video subtitles
In this repository we manage the subtitles of our GOAT tutorial videos. The idea is that for each video we create a directory that contains the files with the subtitles in the the different languages.

As we are using Vimeo for publishing our videos it is important to follow the instructions that are described here: https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224968828-Captions-and-subtitles

The subtitles should be saved in the WebVtt-format and in UTF-8 encoding. In Visual Studio Code an extension is existing for the .vtt file type. You can test the subtitles of the related video with the VLC Media Player. In there they might look a bit different then in Vimeo but in principle it should be the same.
